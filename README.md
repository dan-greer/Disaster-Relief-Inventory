# Disaster-Relief-Inventory

### About
Written during The Ohio State University's HackOHI/O 2018, the application serves to display resources and quantities at user-defined locations during natural disasters.  First responders and government officials can use the application to create an inventory for all of their shelter locations, which provides an HTML file that can be uploaded for those in need to view locations and available resources.  This was designed to solve JPMorgan Chase's Disaster Relief Challenge.
